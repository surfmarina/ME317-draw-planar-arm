function v_set_R = vector_set_rotate(v_set, R_set)
% Rotate a set of vectors specified in local coordinates by a set of
% rotation matrices that specifies the orientations of the frames in which
% the vectors are defined.
%
% Inputs:
%
%   v_set: a 1xn cell array, each element of which is a 2x1 or 3x1 vector,
%       which define vectors in local frames of reference
%   R_set: a 1xn cell array, each element of which is a 2x2 or 3x3 rotation
%       matrix (with the size matching the size of the vectors in v_set),
%       which define the orientations of the frames in which the vectors
%       from v_set are defined
%
% Output:
%
%   v_set_R: a 1xn cell array, each element of which is an 2x1 or 3x1 vector,
%       which are the vectors from v_set, but rotated into the world frame

    %%%%%%%%
    % Start by copying v_set into a new variable v_set_R;
    v_set_R = v_set;

    % Loop over v_set_R, multiplying each vector by the corresponding
