function R_set = planar_rotation_set(joint_angles)
% Generate a set of planar rotation matrices corresponding to the angles in
% the input vector
%
% Input:
%
%   joint_angles: a 1xn or nx1 vector of joint angles
        s = size(joint_angles);
        len = max(s); % this will grab the longest length
%
% Output:
%
%   R_set: a cell array of the same size as the vector angles, in which
%       each cell contains the planar rotation matrix for the angle in the
%       corresponding entry of the vector

    %%%%%%%
    % First, create an empty cell array called R_set that is the same size
    % as the vector of joint angles, using the 'cell' and 'size' functions
    R_set = cell(s);
 
    %%%%%%%
    % Loop over the joint angles, creating a rotation matrix and placing it
    % in the corresponding entry of R_set
    i = 1;

    for i = 1:len
        angle = joint_angles(i);
        R_set{i} = (R_planar(angle));
    end
